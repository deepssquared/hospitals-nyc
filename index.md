## Yelp Ratings and Healthcare in New York City

It was a question that came randomly to mind. So I did what millienials do and tweeted it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/epitwitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#epitwitter</a> ! has anyone tried pulling yelp ratings and reviews of hospitals and mapped them alongside SES/racial demographics in the United States? Potentially using GIS tools? I&#39;d be very interested to see this!</p>&mdash; Deeps (@deepssquared) <a href="https://twitter.com/deepssquared/status/1183908738031390721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote>

I got quite a few responses, many of them expressing interest.

### Limitations

There was a response I got on Twitter that sums up the limitations of this basic data project: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Will put money down that reviews correlate positively with % of floor covered with marble and granite. <br><br>Independent predictor is the presence of a fountain.<br><br>Reviews have little to do with physician quality and more to do with perception of &quot;service&quot;.</p>&mdash; Andrej Spec, MD, MSCI (@FungalDoc) <a href="https://twitter.com/FungalDoc/status/1184140735144255489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote>
